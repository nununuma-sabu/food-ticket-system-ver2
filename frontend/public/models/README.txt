IMPORTANT: You need to place face-api.js models in this directory.
Models needed:
- tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json (and shard1)
- face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json (and shard1)
- age_gender_model-weights_manifest.json (and shard1)

For this prototype, we will assume these files are present or use a mocked version if files are missing?
Actually, since I cannot download files from external URLs easily properly without user interaction sometimes, I will try to mock or use a script.
Wait, I can use curl/wget if the URL is known.
I will try to download them from a reliable CDN or repo.
